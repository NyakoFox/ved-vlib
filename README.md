# Ved Playtesting (VLIB)

A plugin which allows you to playtest your VVVVVV level INSIDE of Ved! No corners cut, no compromises -- just VVVVVV!

> [!WARNING]
> This requires Ved 1.11.1 or later, which you can download [here](https://tolp.nl/ved/download).

## Wait, what?

This is a Ved plugin that contains compiled modified versions of VVVVVV, and a huge framework that allows VVVVVV and Ved to interact with one another. Basically, it glues VVVVVV and Ved together.

## How do I use it?

- Download a release on the sidebar
- Put the downloaded `playtesting.zip` in your plugins path
- Open Ved
- Click yes when it asks if you want to download VVVVVV
- Wait for it to tell you it's done
- Playtesting should now work!

## How do I update VVVVVV?

Simply open Ved when there's a new verison of VVVVVV available, and it will ask you if you want to download the new version.

## How do I update the plugin?

This is a bit more manual -- you have to download the new release and replace the old folder/`.zip` with the new one.

## Screenshots?
